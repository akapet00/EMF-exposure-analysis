# Application of automatic differentiation in electromagnetic dosimetry - assessment of the absorbed power density in the mmWave frequency spectrum

This repository holds the code for the conference paper *Application of automatic differentiation in electromagnetic dosimetry - assessment of the absorbed power density in the mmWave frequency spectrum*, in proceedings of 2021 6th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech).


## Abstract

This paper introduces the concept of automatic differentiation in the evaluation of the absorbed power density in the mmWave frequency spectrum for the new generation of mobile telecommunication technology. Automatic differentiation has been shown to be far superior over numerical differentiation by means of speed and accuracy. To demonstrate the full capacity of the proposed method, a comprehensive analysis of computing the absorbed power density on the surface of irradiated human skin in various configurations is presented.
