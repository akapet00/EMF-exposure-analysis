## Abstract

In this work, we propose a novel procedure for the spatial averaging of the absorbed power density (APD) on complex conformal anatomical models, which is a crucial step in the advancement of accurate dosimetry. To validate our method, the electromagnetic (EM) dosimetric analysis is performed for an ear model exposed to a plane wave at 60 GHz. We investigate the influence of two factors on the spatial-average APD: (i) the shape of the averaging surface (square and disk), and (ii) the polarization of the incident field. According to analyzed exposure scenarios, the spatial-average APD variations as a function of the averaging surface shape are less significant (tenfold) than those related to the polarization of the incident field.
