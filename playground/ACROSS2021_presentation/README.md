# Accurate numerical approach to solving the surface integral of a vector field

This repository holds the code for the presentation *Accurate numerical approach to solving the surface integral of a vector field*, presented at the 6-th Int'l Workshop on Advanced Cooperative Systems on December 3rd, 2021.


## Overview

This talk overviews a numerical technique for evaluation of the surface integral of a vector field. Such an approach is ever necessary in the field of computer dosimetry and is motivated to better evaluate the absorbed electromagnetic power density at the body surface, which is currently used as the reference level for human exposure to electromagnetic fields for frequencies of 6 GHz or more. The work presented here allows the utilization of much more complex body models, which deviate from the ubiquitous canonical geometries, e.g., block representation of the human head, and with that it offers an advancement in the accuracy of the overall surface integral. A toy example is also given to substantiate previous claims.
