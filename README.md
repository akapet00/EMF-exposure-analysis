# README

This repository contains the code I use for the electromagnetic (EM) dosimetry research within my PhD.
The code for each published paper (conference or journal) is open sourced and freely available in `playground` directory.
To reproduce the results, `dosipy` should be installed by pulling the contents of this repository on your local machine and running
```shell
pip install .
```
The best practice is to create a local environment, e.g., using `conda`,
```shell
conda create --name dosipy python=3.9.12
```
and, inside the environment, installing all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
