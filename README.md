# README

This repository contains the code I use for some of the electromagnetic (EM) dosimetry and exposure assessment research during my PhD.
The code for each published paper (conference or journal) is open sourced and freely available in `playground` directory.
To reproduce the results, `dosipy` should be installed by pulling the contents of this repository on your local machine and running
```shell
pip install .
```
The best practice is to create a local environment, e.g., using `conda`,
```shell
conda create --name dosipy python=3.9.12
```
and, inside the environment, installing all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
